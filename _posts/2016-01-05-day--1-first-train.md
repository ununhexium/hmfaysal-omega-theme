After a trip trough the Alps and Switzerland, I have a 1 hour stop at Milano, where it is only 5 degrees by this time of the year.

One train later, I arrive at Firenze and meet a russian girl from Saint Petersburg where it's now -18 while we have 15 arround here. We spend the evening walking downtown and watch the chrismas decorations illuminating the streets and walls, talking about sightseing.
