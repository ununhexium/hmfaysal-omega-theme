The city had once a restiction:
any new building had to be built within the walls of the city,
which lead to very high buildings and very narrow streets.

People ended up building over the roman amphitheater and here is the inside of one of these houses,
currently still inhabited by napolitans.

The hostel where I stayed was at the top of one of those high buildings and was built when Chritopher Columbus "discovered" "India".

Napoli has an extensive underground aqueducts system which was built by the greeks and extended by the romans.
It's been used recently as a shelter during the second world war 
and as a lab to test the growth of plants in a constant 12 degrees, 85 percent humidity location.

The war decorations have been added later to remember people that these galleries were used during the second world war.
